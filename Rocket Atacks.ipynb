Almost all of the incidents were mortar attacks, as the Qassam rocket was first launched on July 10 of the year, and first used against civilian targets in October and November, when four rockets were fired on Sderot in Israel and various Gush Katif settlements in the Gaza Strip.[1][2]\\nIn 2001, Israel maintained a military and civilian presence in the Gaza Strip. This list includes attacks on Israel proper and on Israeli civilian communities in the Gaza Strip, but not on Israeli military targets in the territory.
